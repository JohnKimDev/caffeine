## Version 0.2.0
- NEW: true/false parameter added to placeholder mixin in order to define placeholder styles to element itself of its children.
- CHANGED: arrow mixin changed only for using single :pseudo element for each triangle.
- FIX: Missing $base-font-size for font calculations. Since the $base-font-size variable was orginally defined in Melange settings.
